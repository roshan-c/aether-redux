-- This is how you comment
-- This is how you define a local variable, otherwise it is global
local a = ("A says Hello World")
-- Printing works the exact same as Python, yet to see a change
print("Hello World")
print(a)
-- This is how you define a function, you must type end at the end
function b()
    print("B says Hello World")
end
b()
